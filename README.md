# Hey there! 👋 

I'm a driven **Cybersecurity Enthusiast** pursuing **SOC Analyst** and **Penetration Testing** certifications through TryHackMe, with a knack for building secure Web3/Web2 applications. I thrive on mastering threat detection, incident response, and offensive security while crafting robust, decentralized solutions.

## 💻 What I Do
- **Cybersecurity Training**: Progressing through TryHackMe’s **SOC Analyst (SAL1, SOC Level 1/2)**, **Jr Penetration Tester (PT1)**, **Web Application Pentesting**, **Red Teaming**, **Advanced Endpoint Investigations**, and **Defending Azure** paths.
- **Web Application Security**: Securing apps against vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, and SQL injection, following OWASP Top 10.
- **Web3 Development**: Self-taught in building DApps and auditing smart contracts on Sonic and Fantom mainnets.
- **Full-Stack Development**: Creating web apps with JavaScript/TypeScript, React, and Node.js.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Cybersecurity**: Splunk, Elastic Stack (ELK), Wireshark, Security Onion, TheHive, VirusTotal, Autopsy, Nmap, sqlmap, Burp Suite, Metasploit
- **Web3 Security**: Slither, Mythril, Hardhat, Truffle
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Solidity
- **Frontend**: React, CSS, SCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Flask, Django
- **Tools**: Git, Docker, Webpack, npm/yarn, MetaMask, Rabby

## 🌟 Highlighted Projects
- **Fantomon**: NFT collection on Fantom Mainnet with secure smart contracts.
- **Runescribe**: Diablo 2-style idle NFT PvP game on Sonic Testnet with $S/$RG tokens.
- **DeFi Horse Betting DApp**: Decentralized finance app with token staking and horse betting on Sonic Mainnet.
- **Gundam Pool Staking DApp**: Gundam-themed DApp with dynamic pool staking and live tweaks (undermining, boosts, levels, research, fortification) on Sonic Mainnet.
- ** rect-NIDS ** PCAP Intrustion Analyzer ( made this to read PCAP files in a fast pace environment for modules on Tryhackme.)

## 🔒 Security Focus
Actively training in **SOC operations** (SAL1, SOC Level 1/2) and **penetration testing** (PT1, Web App Pentesting, Red Teaming) via TryHackMe, mastering SIEMs, threat hunting, and forensic analysis. I also audit self-taught Web3 projects, securing smart contracts against reentrancy and phishing exploits using tools like Slither and Mythril.

## ⚡ Fun Facts
- Fueled by coffee and late-night TryHackMe labs.
- Self-taught Web3 dev, turning Gundam-inspired ideas into decentralized reality.
- Believe great security is like clean code: precise, impactful, and elegant.
