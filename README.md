# Hey there! 👋 

I'm a passionate **Cybersecurity Enthusiast** and **Web3/Web2 Developer** focused on building secure, scalable solutions and mastering SOC operations. I love diving into threat detection, incident response, and secure coding to solve real-world problems.

## 💻 What I Do
- **Cybersecurity**: Training in **SOC Analyst (SAL1)** and **Pentester Learning Paths** on TryHackMe, specializing in log analysis, incident response, and penetration testing.
- **Web Application Security**: Securing apps with OWASP Top 10 best practices and proactive vulnerability mitigation.
- **Full-Stack Development**: Building web apps with JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Node.js, and robust backends.
- **Web3 Development**: Crafting DApps and smart contracts in Solidity for decentralized ecosystems like Sonic and Fantom mainnets.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Cybersecurity**: Splunk, Elastic Stack (ELK), Wireshark, Security Onion, TheHive, VirusTotal, Autopsy
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Solidity
- **Frontend**: React, CSS, SCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Flask, Django
- **Web3**: Ethereum, Sonic, Fantom, Hardhat, Truffle, MetaMask
- **Tools**: Git, Docker, Webpack, npm/yarn

## 🌟 Highlighted Projects
- **[Fantomon]**: NFT collection on Fantom Mainnet with secure smart contracts.
- **[Runescribe]**: Diablo 2-style idle NFT PvP game on Sonic Testnet, featuring $S/$RG tokens.
- **[DeFi Horse Betting DApp]**: Decentralized finance app with token staking and horse betting mechanics on Sonic Mainnet, integrating secure wallet authentication.
- **[Gundam Pool Staking DApp]**: Gundam-themed DApp with dynamic pool staking, live tweaks via undermining, boosts, levels, research, and fortification on Sonic Mainnet.

## 🔒 Security Focus
Deeply engaged in **SOC operations** (TryHackMe SAL1) and **penetration testing** (TryHackMe Pentester Path), mastering SIEMs, threat hunting, and forensic analysis. I also audit smart contracts and secure DApps against exploits like reentrancy and phishing.

## ⚡ Fun Facts
- I thrive on coffee-fueled coding sessions and threat hunting labs.
- Always experimenting with APIs and Web3 protocols to build innovative solutions.
- Good code and good security are like a perfect Gundam build: precise and impactful.
