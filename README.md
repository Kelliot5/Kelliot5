## 🌟 Highlights
- **[Fantomon]**: [NFT Collection on Fantom Maintnet
- **[Runescribe]**: [Diablo 2 Style IDLE NFT PVP Terminal Game

## 🔒 Security Focus
I’m deeply interested in web application security—ensuring applications are robust against threats like XSS, CSRF, and SQL injection. I follow secure coding principles and enjoy digging into the latest security research.

## ⚡ Fun Facts
- I’m always experimenting with new APIs to see what I can build.
- Coffee and code are my fuel—preferably together!
- I believe good code is like a good joke: clean, clever, and impactful.
